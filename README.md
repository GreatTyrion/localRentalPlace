# localRentalPlace project
This project includes three python files.

web_scraping_from_kijiji.py is used to obtain all the rent information from St.John's Kijiji. 

create_geocode.py is used to geocode all the addresses of the rental places. 

Map_rental_places.py is used to generate google map with all the rental palces on it. 

To use these python files, you need to have a knowledge of python. So you can modify the code to scrape your interested website and customize your google map.
